Design Patterns:
  In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly 
  occurring problem in software design. 
  
  A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. 
  It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different 
  situations.


What is GOF patterns in Ooad?

The GoF Design Patterns are broken into three categories: 
  Creational Patterns for the creation of objects; 
  Structural Patterns to provide relationship between objects; and finally, 
  Behavioral Patterns to help define how objects interact.


  Creational Design Patterns:
  ---------------------------

  These design patterns are all about class instantiation. 
  This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. 
  While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, 
  object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

  Structural design patterns:
  ----------------------------

  These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.
   Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. 
   Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

   Behavioral design patterns:
   ----------------------------
   These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. 
   Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with 
   communication between objects.
